# Fundamentals of Survival time data

These notes are done based on the book *Survival Analysis: Techniques for Censored and Truncated Data by John P. Klein and Melvin L. Moeschberger*.

## Background

- **Survival time** data is also called **Time-to-event** or **Failure time** data. 

- So what are these **events**? The examples include development (or, recurrence) of a disease, appearance of a tumor, death, or failure of machine etc. Wait, the events can be good events too! For example, time to remission after treatment, cessation of smoking, etc.
